# End-to-end-Planning (UniAD Replication)

## Introduction

This repository is for the record of my daily updates on the replication of UniAD. Developed a Birdâ€™s-Eye-View (BEV) Vision Reconstruction model to transform multi-camera
feeds into comprehensive BEV environmental representations, encompassing 3D Object Detection, Tracking and Semantic Segmentation, Motion Forcasting and Planning.
